## node-cntk : Node.js bindings for CNTK (work in progress)

This node.js module provides node.js native bindings for <a href="">CNTK</a>, Microsoft's deep learning library.

Currently supports Windows x64. Please note that the module is currently bundled with the required CNTK and CUDA DLL files. (Hence the large package size). The additional DLL files are located under the CNTK/DLL folder.

### What is it good for?

node-cntk is currently meant to only support <b>model evaluation</b>. (e.g. test time).

That is, you need to first train you model using CNTK's python (or Brain-Script) API, and then consume it in node.js using this module.

### How to use?

1. Require the module and set the default device:

```javascript
const cntk = require('node-cntk');

try {
    // try to set the default device to GPU with device Id 0
    cntk.setDefaultDeviceSync(cntk.devices.gpu /*, deviceId (default is 0) */);
}
catch(ex) {
    // failed to set device to GPU, try to set to CPU instead
    cntk.setDefaultDeviceSync(cntk.devices.cpu);
}
```

Note that for now you can set the device globally, in the future this module will support choosing the device per operation.

2. Load the model using the <b>loadModel</b> async method:

```javascript
// Load the model 
var modelPath = path.join(__dirname, 'mnist', 'mnist_conv.cmf');

cntk.loadModel(modelPath, (err, model) => {
    if (err) {
        console.info('Got error:', err);
        return;
    }
    console.info('Got model!')

    // do something with the model
    // ...
});
```

3. Evaluate a sample (or samples) using the loaded model:

```javascript
// get the data sample
var dataSample = [...];

// the input data is a batch of data, e.g. array of arrays/buffers, etc:
inputData = [dataSample]

// Alternatively, you can also provide a dictionary where each key is the name of the input variable, and the value is the data. // This is useful in case your model have more than input variables. 
//inputData = {
//    'input' : [ dataSample ]
//}

// In case you are interested in a specific output variable, you can explicitly provide a list if output variable names
// that the eval function will get the evaluation for.
// If you don't provide any, the eval function will just return the default model output variables.

//outputVariables = ['output']
    
model.eval(inputData, /* outputVariables, */ (err, res)=>{
    if (err) {
        console.info(err);
        return;
    }

    // Print the result object.
    // The result object will hold an object with the name of the output variable as key, and for each key 
    // the value will be an array with the evaluation result for each data samples 
    
    console.info('Eval result:', res);

    // For the MNIST example, we will have the following output 
    // (note that "output" is the name of the model's output variable):
    // 
    // Eval result: { output:
    // [ [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
    // [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 ] ] }
    //
})
```

### TODO

Current list of major work items (For full list, please refer to the issues tab):

- [x] Basic native bindings for setDefaultDevice, loadModel, and eval.
- [x] Basic sample with local model evaluation.
- [ ] Extend native Model class APIs to support model inspection in JavaScript code.
- [ ] MNIST model web server sample.
- [ ] Keras sample: train Keras model with CNTK backend and then load it in node.js.
